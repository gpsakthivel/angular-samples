In this project, I worked on the CRUD operation.

Learning:
- [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/)
- [JSON server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) 

Steps to open and run the project:
- Open the project by using the below command.
```
ng serve
```
- Run the json server by the below command: `json-server --watch FILENAME`
```
json-server --watch db.json
```
